# Compiler Design Lab
A repository of files and programs built for the course, 'Compiler Design Lab' (CS305), at NITK.

All files and programs in this repository (except for the question files for each assignment) were created on a Linux machine. I highly recommend using Linux for creating, compiling, and running Lex and Yacc programs, since almost everyone uses Linux for the same, and since everyone does, collaborating with others while using a Windows machine could become a problem. There are a few changes one has to make for running these programs on Windows, and I've heard there are slightly different installation and compilation procedures as well. To avoid this 'incompatibility' every time you collaborate with others, use Linux.

In case you're against the idea of dual-booting Windows and Linux on your Windows machine, I would recommend downloading the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS application from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N9TNGVNDL3Q), which allows one to use Ubuntu Terminal from inside Windows

See the screenshots and/or README files associated with each assignment for usage instructions.
